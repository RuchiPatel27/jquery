OutputCaache Attribute
	Is used to cache the content returned by a controller action method,so that,the same content does not need to be generated each and every time the same controller is invoked.
Default time for output cache
	10 second
The advantages of EF are given bellow:

It provides auto generated code
It reduce development time
It reduce development cost
It enables developers to visually design models and mapping of database
It provides capability of programming a conceptual model.
It provides unique syntax (LINQ / Yoda) for all object queries whether it is database or not
It allow multiple conceptual models to mapped to a single storage schema
Itâ€™s easy to map business objects (with drag & drop tables).
Disadvantages of Entity Framework
The disadvantages of EF are given bellow:

Lazy loading is the main drawbacks of EF
Its syntax is complicated
Its logical schema is not able to understand business entities and relation among each other
Logical schema of database is not capable of using certain parts of application
It is not available for every RDMS
Need to handle data in nontraditional way
It does not work if we change any schema of the database. We need to update the schema on the solution.
It is not good for huge domain model.
